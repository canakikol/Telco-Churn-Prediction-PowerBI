Telco Churn Analysis: Customer Loss Prediction \& Action Plan

About the Project

This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecommunications sector and to develop data-driven, actionable strategies to reduce it.

Machine learning–based Risk Scores were visualized using Power BI to support executive-level decision-making.

Methodology \& Tools Used

Data Analysis \& Preparation:

Missing and inconsistent data were cleaned, and categorical variables were processed.

Machine Learning (Modeling):

A classification model (typically Logistic Regression or Random Forest) was used to predict customer churn probability (Risk Score).

Risk Score Integration:

Model outputs (Risk Score: 0.00–1.00) were integrated into the main dataset to identify the churn risk for each customer.

Data Visualization:

An interactive 3-page Power BI report was created to summarize findings and insights.

Core Tools Used:

Power BI, Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)

Key Insights (Actionable Findings)

The report revealed three major drivers behind customer churn—operational risks and loyalty factors:



1- High-Risk Segment Identification

Finding: The highest churn risk is concentrated among Month-to-Month contract Fiber Optic customers with a short tenure (first 12 months).

(Churn Rate in this segment: ~60%)

Recommendation:

Launch an Emergency Retention Program offering discounted rates or free premium services in exchange for contract renewal.

2- Payment Method Vulnerability

Finding: Customers using Electronic Check as their payment method show significantly higher churn rates than others.

Recommendation:

Offer small monthly discounts to encourage these customers to switch to more reliable and cost-effective options such as AutoPay.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

3- Loyalty Drivers

Finding: Customers not subscribed to add-on services like Online Security or Tech Support show a considerably higher churn rate.

Recommendation:

Provide free access to these services for the first 6 months, especially for new customers, to improve long-term loyalty.
